Hey everybody, we announce the immediate release of 0.14.0. Here the resume of
the changes which have been made:

### Dojo

* Update the toolkit to version 1.8.4
* Add a `dojo_config` helper to simplify configuration:

  You can override the value of the `dojoConfig` javascript variable thanks to
this helper. For instance:

  ~~~erb
  <%= dojo_config :has => {:dojo_firebug => true} %>
  ~~~

### Dijit

* Update the toolkit to 1.8.4 as well

### Dojox

* Also update the toolkit to 1.8.4
* Fix an issue with assets loading :

  Thanks to [sjerman](https://github.com/sjerman), the main include statement
in `lib/dojox-rails` has been corrected to fix [#1].

Thanks everyone for your contribution and for using Dojo!
